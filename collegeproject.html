            <a ><span>Name    :</span> An ontology on the security of web application (Security-Domain) </a><br>
           <br> <a ><span>Description :</span>A web application is computer programing that utilizes web browsers and web technology to perform tasks over the Internet.
            In This Project we Use Encryption and Decryption technique for Secure User Data Store in DataBase from any Type of Hacking like sql injection attack etc</a><br>
           <br> <a ><span>Used Language    :</span> HTML,CSS and JS </a><br>

            <a ><span>Name    :</span> Smart IoT based home automation system  </a><br>
            <br><a ><span>Description :</span> Nowadays everything is getting automatized and digitalized, Human life is getting easier day by day as the things which were time consuming and requires human efforts are no more there in our life. Now Old manual systems are getting replaced by IoT systems which are reducing human efforts. Internet of things(IoT)  provides us a Platform that makes connection of devices, which are used for sensing, controlling and which can be accessed from any where we want,i.e we can access IoT devices remotely.We are using  Voice recognition System to Control home automation systems.</a><br>
            <br><a ><span>Used Hardware :</span>NodeMcu WiFi Board,Relay Module 4CH 5Volt,bettery,jumble cables,HOME Equipment which we want to control like bulb,tv,freez,ac ...etc </a><br>
            <a ><span>Used Software :</span> Ardunio software,Blynk app,Google assistent,IFTTT </a><br>
